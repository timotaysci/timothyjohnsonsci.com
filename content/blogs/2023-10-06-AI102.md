# Taking the AI-102 Certification

Transitioning from my background in Chemical R&D to a role within the IT function was a significant leap for me. I was quickly introduced to the world of continuous learning within the realm of IT. The need to adapt and keep up with ever-evolving technologies was evident, and I realized the importance of certifications in validating my knowledge. This led me to embark on the AI-102 certification journey, and I want to share my experience and insights with you.
Studying for AI-102

### Level of Difficulty

The AI-102 certification, in comparison to the AI-900 or AZ-900, is notably more challenging. It demands a deeper understanding of Azure services and AI concepts. Don't underestimate the preparation required.

### Preparation Resources

To kickstart my preparation, I first delved into the Microsoft Learn modules. However, I found that these materials alone were not sufficient for me. I needed more comprehensive and engaging resources.

### Supplemental Courses

To complement my learning, I enrolled in a Udemy course focused on AI-102. This allowed me to gain a more practical understanding of the concepts and hands-on experience.

### Exam Cram

Additionally, I found John Saville's "exam cram" materials to be quite useful. They provided a concise overview of the key topics and helped me review efficiently.
### Command Proficiency

Unlike some other certifications, the AI-102 exam places heavy emphasis on knowing commands related to Azure and AI services. These commands can be daunting at first, so practice is essential.

### Open Book Exam

One surprising revelation was that the AI-102 exam is an open book test. This means you have access to documentation during the exam. I was unaware of this initially, so it's crucial to allocate some time to familiarize yourself with the Azure and AI documentation.

### Preparation Pays Off

Thanks to thorough preparation, I felt confident entering the exam room. Remember to bring government-issued photo ID as it is required for sign-in.

### Multiple Questions in One

Much like the AZ-900 exam, the AI-102 exam consists of multiple questions grouped together. Initially, it might seem like you're facing fewer questions, but each group contains multiple sub-questions. Be prepared for this format.

### Mark for Later

Use the "mark for later" feature during the exam whenever you're uncertain about an answer. This allows you to revisit those questions before submitting your final answers.

### Time management

 including sign-in, took me about 70 minutes. 

## Conclusion

So, is pursuing the AI-102 certification worth it? Absolutely, especially if you're looking to solidify your knowledge in Azure and AI. While it's more challenging than introductory certifications like AI-900 or AZ-900, the learning process is immensely valuable. You'll not only gain technical expertise but also an understanding of how these exams work.

If you're new to the IT space, the AI-102 certification can be a game-changer. However, if you're already experienced in taking certification exams, consider your career goals and whether other paths may have a more significant impact.

In the ever-evolving world of technology, certifications like AI-102 are not just about the destination; they're also about the journey of continuous learning and growth. Embrace it, and you'll find yourself well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
