## Introduction

Becoming a parent is an incredible journey filled with joy, challenges, and life-changing moments. As a working parents, taking shared parental leave can be both exhilarating and filled with guilt about leaving work behind. I recently embarked on my first week of shared parental leave with our 4-month-old daughter, and it was a rollercoaster of emotions . In this blog, I'll share my observations, from the guilt of leaving work to the delightful experiences we had during this special week.

### 1. Guilt About Leaving Work

Leaving work behind to take care of my baby for a week was not as straightforward as it might seem. Guilt crept in, as I worried about the unfinished tasks at the office and the potential impact on my career. However, I soon realized that this time with my daughter was invaluable, and the guilt began to subside as I immersed myself in the beautiful world of parenting.

### 2. Naps Are Key to Forcing a Schedule

Babies thrive on routine, and I quickly learned the importance of naps in establishing a schedule. Naps became my secret weapon for maintaining a sense of order in our daily life, and I soon understood that a well-rested baby is a happier one.

### 3. Discovering Activities for Parents and Children

One of the most surprising discoveries during my parental leave was the wide array of activities available for parents and children. I had never noticed the wealth of options in our community before.

#### 3a. Swimming Adventures

One standout experience was our trip to the local swimming pool. Watching my daughter's eyes light up with excitement as we introduced her to the water was an unforgettable moment. She absolutely loved it, and it was a fantastic bonding experience for both of us.

#### 3b. Library Rhymes and a First Library Card

Another highlight was our visit to the local library, where we joined a rhyming session for babies. Not only did we have a great time singing along, but we also got our daughter her first library card, marking the beginning of her literary journey.

#### 3c. Play Days at the Local Church

We also attended play days at the local church, where we connected with other parents and children. These gatherings offered an opportunity for our daughter to socialize and for me to share experiences and insights with other dads.

### 4. Normalizing Dads Taking Time with Their Kids

One of the most heartening observations during my week of shared parental leave was the number of dads actively engaged in childcare. It was evident that spending time with their kids was a priority for them, and it felt like a positive shift towards a more inclusive and equal parenting experience.

### 5. The Magic of Baby Conversations

As we embarked on our various adventures, I discovered that having a baby is a guaranteed conversation starter. People, both young and old, couldn't resist striking up a conversation with us. It was heartwarming to share stories, advice, and a few laughs with strangers who instantly became friends, all because of our little bundle of joy.

## Conclusion

My first week of shared parental leave was an incredible experience, filled with love, learning, and adventures. It taught me the importance of embracing parenthood fully, letting go of work-related guilt, and cherishing the magical moments with my daughter. I also realized that our community is brimming with activities for parents and children, and that spending quality time with your child is a norm worth celebrating.

As I returned to work, I carried with me the memories of that special week, knowing that shared parental leave is a wonderful opportunity for parents to create lasting bonds with their children. I can't wait for the next time I get to step out of my professional role and immerse myself in the joy of being a dad once again.
