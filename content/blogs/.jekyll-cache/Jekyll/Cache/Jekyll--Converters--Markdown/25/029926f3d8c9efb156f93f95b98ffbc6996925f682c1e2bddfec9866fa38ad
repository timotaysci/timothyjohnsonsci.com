<p>I have had some issues with crackling sound and Steam on my latest build - notably during Fallout 4.</p>

<p>To fix this I came across this post and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ-Ml78kiEE">video</a> - unfortunately the links in the video are dead.</p>

<p>I believe it is caused by high rate sample rate audio being play though low rate kit.</p>

<p>For my future reference and for anyone also stumbling across this - I please see a link to my <a href="https://github.com/timotayj/PulseAudioFix">git</a> up which has the pulse audio .conf fig file that - at least for now- works for me.</p>

<p>To use - backup your /etc/pulse/daemon.conf file with the below code to save a copy in your home dir:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo cp /etc/pulse/daemon.conf daemon.conf_working
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then either clone file from git or change manually with</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf 
</code></pre></div></div>
