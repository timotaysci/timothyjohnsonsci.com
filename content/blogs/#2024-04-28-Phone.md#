# Context 

I use my phone to much. 

This is a statement likely rings true with you too. 

Need to use phone for banking, card and, most imporatnyl with a one year old, photos! My google pixel has one of the most amazing camaeras I've seen in a phone, and I wnat all those great images to be saved and shared with the people I love. So a real dumb phone would be something I could not in good faith take

difficulty in blocking apps - digital well being not perfect - cannot install youtube for example

short form cotent is killing my focus - real need to extend contnet - either especally with books.
