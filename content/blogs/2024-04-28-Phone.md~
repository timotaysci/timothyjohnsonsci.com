A year ago I transitioned from my background in Chemical R&D to a role within the IT function - a significant leap for me. I was quickly introduced to the world of continuous learning within the realm of IT and the well defined certification paths - something, I believe, is lacking within the chemical space. 

The need to adapt and keep up with ever-evolving technologies was evident and I realized the importance of certifications in validating my knowledge. This led me to embark on the AI-102 certification journey, and I want to share my experience and insights with you.

## Studying for AI-102

I have two other Microsoft certificates, importantly these were foundational exams requiring significantly less preparation time but, also, they pre-date the birth of our first child. 

You can read my exam stories for foundation Azure 900 exam [here]( https://timothyjohnsonsci.com/blogs/2023-04-08-az-900/). 

### Level of Difficulty

The AI-102 certification, in comparison to the AI-900 or AZ-900, is notably more challenging. It demands a deeper understanding of Azure services and AI concepts. Don't underestimate the preparation required. This requires knowing API end point, being able to read and understand code along with general information about Microsoft AI services.

This is coupled with significantly less time in my personal life for prep. Starting in May it took me until October to finally sit the exam. This was not full time studying - I estimate I covered the material in ~ 20 hours but, with other commitments, my exam could only really be stat in October.

### Preparation Resources

To kickstart my preparation, I first delved into the  [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ai-102/modules). However, I found that these materials alone were not totally sufficient. I needed more.  To complement my learning, I enrolled in a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai102-azure/) course focused on AI-102. This allowed me to gain a understanding of the concepts from a different perspective. Additionally, I found [John Savill's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7fdWafTcPY) "exam cram" materials to be quite useful. I think this is of benefit to watch before any preparation and then once more after. It provided a concise overview of the key topics and helped me review efficiently.


What struck me is the lack of good quality material for this course. While the resources above are good they are the only real options. I hope this gets better moving forward. 

### Command Proficiency

Unlike  my other certification experience, the AI-102 exam places heavy emphasis on knowing commands related to Azure and AI services. These commands can be daunting at first, so practice is essential. What helped me was realising that these were written by humans and, presumably, not meant to trip up developers. Often the answer is logical and ,once you understand what service does what, they answer at least has constancy. 

### Open Book Exam

One surprising revelation was that the AI-102 exam is an open book test. This means you have access to [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/) during the exam. A button on the question page will take you the Learn search prompt. 

I was unaware of this until the night before the exam. I think it's crucial to allocate some time to familiarize yourself with the Learn documentation. You do not have time to look up everything so it critical to answer what you can and know where in the documentation answers can be found. 



## Taking the AI-102 Exam


### Questions 

Much like the AZ-900 and AI-900 exams, the AI-102 exam consists of multiple questions, some of them grouped together. Unlike those exams the AI-102 also consisted of two case studies. The first gave you some background information about a scenario and asked you a series of questions that satisfied a technical requirement. Make sure you read all the material they give you. At the end of the five questions you had to confirm you were happy with your answers as you could not come back.

The second was a series of linked questions about the same application that occurred at the very end of the test. Once you had answered one question you could not go back. This threw me a little as I couldn't rely on the "review" feature.  


### Mark for Later

Use the "mark for later" feature during the exam whenever you're uncertain about an answer. This allows you to revisit those questions before submitting your final answers. Well over half my questions were marked for review.

This may seem like a lack of confidence (and maybe it was) but I managed to convince myself that it was strategy. Due to the open nature of the exam, I took the approach that anything I thought I could confirm in the documentation I would review at the end. 

### Time management

It took me about an hour to complete the exam with 20 minutes left over. I could have taken longer to confirm some questions in the documentation but I was confident with the vast majority of the answers. The take away, I believe, is you do have plenty of time but not if you need to look up everything. 

## Conclusion

So, is pursuing the AI-102 certification worth it? I hope so, especially as I was  looking to solidify my knowledge in Azure and AI. While it's more challenging than introductory certifications like AI-900 or AZ-900, the learning process is valuable. You'll not only gain technical expertise but also an understanding of how these exams work.

If you're new to the IT space, the AI-102 certification can be a great cert. However, if you're already experienced in taking certification exams, consider your career goals and whether other paths may have a more significant impact.

In the ever-evolving world of technology, certifications like AI-102 are not just about the destination; they're also about the journey of continuous learning and growth. Embrace it, and you'll find yourself well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

So what next? Onto ITILÂ® Foundation and the Linux+ - then - who knows!
