Last weekend I participated in a Audax 50 km ride in celebration of Johnson and Matthey. While I have been off the bike for a while it was great to get back in the saddle and enjoy a solid ride with friends. For my own sanity I intend to record the following to remind me of what is important:

-   Rain isn't that bad - even with the rain and standing water, you were never *cold*.
-   Food is important - little breakfast and eat at regular intervals.
-   You need to practice dismounts in clipless pedals.
-   Clean your damn bike!
-   50 km isn't that far.
-   50 km in quite a long way.
-   50 km requires rest.
