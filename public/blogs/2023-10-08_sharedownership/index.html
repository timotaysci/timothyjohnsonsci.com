  "articleBody": "Introduction Selling a home is rarely a walk in the park, but when you throw shared ownership, a global pandemic and cladding issues into the mix, you’re in for an adventure. I wanted to chronicle the rollercoaster ride we embarked on when we decided to sell our shared ownership flat. From cladding issues to bureaucratic hurdles, I’ll shed some light on the challenges we faced and how we overcame them.\nThe Decision to Sell (Early 2020): Our journey began in early 2020 when we made the decision to sell our shared ownership flat. We even visited properties and put an offer on one we super liked.\nThe Housing Association These guys want your property to initially be sold to shared ownership buyers which we were super happy with. To be clear, they do not want to buy the flat and resell it, they want you to find such a buyer. They have a website where you can post your shared ownership flat. The website is poor and we got no interest. Additionally they expect your full name, address and email to be posted along with the advert, a mad process in this GDPR landscape. We complained and had the name and address removed.\nDue to lack of interest we had the flat on the website for as short a time as possible before moving forward with a process where we sell 100% of the flat to a buyer.\nThis process also demonstrates a widely unfair aspect of shared ownership. If you cannot sell just your share you need to sell 100% of the property. The housing association will not help you with any of the fees for this. This means that despite owning, say 40% of the property, you need to pay estate agent and lawyer fees on 100% of the property. For the estate agents this is typically a percentage of the sale price. This means, in this scenario, you pay 60% extra to sell the property.\nThe housing association do, however, get to keep any money raised by the property value increasing, which is nice for them.\nThis is an example of what we will see moving forward - the risk and cost is all on the individual home owner and not on the larger corporations\nCladding Work Stopped Everything: Just as we were gearing up to put our flat on the market, the cladding on our building was found to be problematic - bringing the process to a screeching halt. This work put our plans on hold indefinitely.\nIt is worth saying here that I do not begrudge the need for this work. It is clear that unsafe cladding is a real problem and the tragedy of Grenfell showed what happens when this type of cladding is left unchanged. The government needed to act and I’m happy they did.\nThe issue is that these works, often done to replace material put in by large building firms, put owners at in a disproportionate financial position. The flat, until we received the certificate that the work was complete, was essentially worth £0 as no lenders would touch it.\nWe were, at the end of the day, lucky. The work was done within two years. Many are in far worse situations that us and we were told this on several occasions. It is worth stating, just because others are in bad situations does not mean your situation is not, also, bad.\nRenting Out the Flat - A Bureaucratic Nightmare: While waiting for the cladding work to resume, we explored the possibility of renting out the flat so we could move. However, the shared ownership scheme’s approval process for this was incredibly time-consuming. It took nearly 6 months to get to a point where they would agree. However that is not the only part to consider, we would need permission each time we changed tenants, and our mortgage providers demanded tenants lined up before agreeing to new terms. This made renting out our flat nearly impossible.\nAffording a Second Home: Fortuitously, and following financial advice, we were able to purchase a second home to live in while keeping our flat empty. Although expensive, this decision allowed us to move forward with our lives and keep our options open. It should, after all, only be for a few months (?!). We would have to fork out extra for the cost of stamp duty (which we had planned to claim back). I understand how lucky we were here and this is by no means an option for all.\nA New Home (Early 2022): In late 2021, we found a house. We put in an offer and got it accepted. In Early 2022 we got the keys!\nCladding Work Resumes: Around the same time as we completed on the house, the cladding work on our flat was being finalised and the correct certificates obtained. This was a significant relief as it meant our flat would meet safety standards and could be sold to mortgage buyers.\nAt this point the reader should also be aware of an insane and backwards process required to sell a shared ownership flat. The shared ownership association must get the market price for the property when sold on the open market. This protects their investment. Any difference would be covered by us. The valuation must be valid at the time of completion, not accepting the offer.\nTo do this you need a valuation from a professional body that will tell you what the market rate for your property is. This costs in the range of £200 a time. These are valid for between 3 to 6 months.\nNow, imagine a situation where very few properties have been sold in a building and those that have been sold have been sold cheap as they need to go to cash buyers. This would, of course, depress the market value of the properties.\nWorse than that, imagine, if some properties were to sell before a massive correction in the housing market.This would make the property over valued.\nWe had both situations occur. We were lucky to accept an offer and the buyer keep the offer at the same rate. If not we would have to have taken the hit and payed the difference.\nThe undue pressure needed to get dales through in a 3 month time frame is, however, stupid. Very few homes get put on the market and sold in three months. This means the sale could fall through at any time or the difference made up.\nAccepting an Offer (September 2022): We accepted an offer on our shared ownership flat in August 2022. We thought the hardest part was behind us, but we were in for another surprise. A certain short lived PM tanked the economy and interests rates forced the buyer to drop out as their mortgage offer was withdrawn from the banks. We accepted a lower offer in October and aimed to progress.\nExtended Timeline Due to Extra Paperwork: We had a range of delays at this point, some were on us and our lawyers, some on the buyer and their lawyers and some on the estate agent.\nAll is par of the course when it comes to selling a house. The single worst delay was due to the Building Safety Regulation act coming into force in the middle of the sale. As far as we could work out no one knew how this was meant to work, what protections were in place or the process to request various bits of paper work.\nThe sale dragged on for an additional 10 months. The red tape seemed never-ending, and we felt trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of documentation and bureaucracy. More valuations were needed, as these only last between 3 and 6 months, and document packs were also required.\nOur daughter, the main reason we wanted to move, arrived in early 2023. A ray of sunshine in an otherwise silly story.\nFinal hurdle We were all ready to exchange at the start of August. All until a fire survey, something that is needed yearly under new legislation, was shared from the property management company with the sellers lawyers. This contained the revelation that there were issues with the fire doors and that the buyers lenders would not lend unless a estimate of costs was provided.\nThe management company had not progressed this issue, nor raised it with residences, since March 2023. With impending mortgage offers running out we were in real trouble.\nOnly after we requested all documentation and engaged the estate agents did we unblock this, taking nearly three weeks to sort out.\nThis month delay will cost us around £1000, a drop in the bucket for the nearly £30k we expect to be out by the end of this process.\nConclusion I write this on the day we exchange on the flat, nearly four years after we wanted to sell. All said and done there is only a two day window to complete while all documentation is valid. We did this by the skin of our teeth.\nOur journey of selling a shared ownership flat was riddled with issues, from cladding work delays to bureaucratic hurdles and the arrival of our daughter.\nWhile it was a challenging experience, we are grateful to have finally moved on to a new chapter in our lives, one that wouldn’t have been possible without determination and a bit of luck.\nWe hope our story serves as a source of insight for others navigating the complex world of property ownership and sales, especially in unique circumstances like ours.\nThis does not end here, we intend to raise issue further with our MP and various governing bodies to get acknowledgement that things went wrong at various level. Watch this space - I will share more as it occurs\n",

<p>Selling a home is rarely a walk in the park, but when you throw shared ownership, a global pandemic and cladding issues into the mix, you&rsquo;re in for an adventure. I wanted to chronicle the rollercoaster ride we embarked on when we decided to sell our shared ownership flat. From cladding issues to bureaucratic hurdles, I&rsquo;ll shed some light on the challenges we faced and how we overcame them.</p>

<h3 id="final-hurdle">Final hurdle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#final-hurdle">#</a></h3>
<p>We were all ready to exchange at the start of August. All until a fire survey, something that is needed yearly under new legislation, was shared from the property management company with the sellers lawyers. This contained the revelation that there were issues with the fire doors and that the buyers lenders would not lend unless a estimate of costs was provided.</p>
<p>The management company had not progressed this issue, nor raised it with residences, since March 2023. With impending mortgage offers running out we were in real trouble.</p>
<p>Only after we requested all documentation and engaged the estate agents did we unblock this, taking nearly three weeks to sort out.</p>
<p>This month delay will cost us around £1000, a drop in the bucket for the nearly £30k we expect to be out by the end of this process.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>I write this on the day we exchange on the flat, nearly four years after we wanted to sell. All said and done there is only a two day window to complete while all documentation is valid. We did this by the skin of our teeth.</p>
<p>Our journey of selling a shared ownership flat was riddled with issues, from cladding work delays to bureaucratic hurdles and the arrival of our daughter.</p>
<p>While it was a challenging experience, we are grateful to have finally moved on to a new chapter in our lives, one that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without determination and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>We hope our story serves as a source of insight for others navigating the complex world of property ownership and sales, especially in unique circumstances like ours.</p>
<p>This does not end here, we intend to raise issue further with our MP and various governing bodies to get acknowledgement that things went wrong at various level. Watch this space - I will share more as it occurs</p>
