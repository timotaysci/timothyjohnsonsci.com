Whether you’re a researcher, a student, or simply someone trying to keep up with the ever-expanding knowledge base, the ability to navigate and extract meaningful insights from the vast ocean of data online is indispensable.\nI could have written this at any point in the last 20 years. It has always been imperative that an individual is able to reach out to whatever knowledge base is available and extract the right information.\nHowever, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) the dynamics of this skill have shifted. For my feild, the physical sciences, you used to have to know the landscape very well, understand the right principles and know which books or journals in the libuary were the right ones.\nThe Changing Landscape of Information Retrieval I saw a talk during my time as a PhD student in Liverpool. This was given by the inventor of Viagra speaking about its development. He shared the story of how he was only able to conduct the sythisis due to a chance conversation with a colleague who had just read a paper on the exact problem. Had he not had that conversation, who knows if he would have been able to track down the preparation in the physical litrature.\nThe internet allowed for vast ammounts of data to become accessible. You could now serch the literature and read papers from around the world. It then became how much you could read or if a mentor could guide you to understand what was a good and useful paper.\nThen Google happened.\nTools sprung up to help you search but and what became key was your ability to formulate your ask in the right way in order to get Google to give you the right webpage. You would then check the pages, see if it was tangental to your problem, and apply it.\nWith the advent of LLMs, is it time to revisit this paradigm and update these skills for the modern workplace?\nWith LLMs use growing, we are seeing this skill become more relevant - it is English compression that is emerging as the key skill in our interaction with chatbots, making it a vital tool in the modern workplace.\nThe Power of English Compression Interactions with LLMs, as of late 2023, consit of putting together a block of text tht you submit to a model. The block of text contains your prompt along with a system message. This message proceeds your prompt, is often invisible, and normally conatins infomation that grounds the bot. Some examples might be:\nYou are a helpful chatbot who will answer all questions to the best of your ability\nor\nYou are a chatbot that only knows about food recipes, you will politely decline to answer any other questions.\nThe user then enters a prompt, for example:\nWhat should I cook for dinner?\nThis get combined with the system message and you get a resonce, hopefully with a nice soup recipe.\nAll the model is doing if taking these two parts, submitting it to the model and determining what the next token (think word) should be, probabilistically. It then resubmits the whole prompt, plus this extra token and loops until it is happy. 1\nBecause of this any extra context you give it, and give it in the right format, is key to getting the best answer out. Being able to formulate your ask in propper english, allowing the bot to comprehend, the better (and more relivant) the answer you will get\nConclusion As we move further into the digital era, chatbots are becoming an integral part of our everyday lives. Mastering the skill of English comprehension is the key to unlocking the full potential of these AI-driven conversational agents. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or professional, this skill will be essential in maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of your interactions with chatbots.\nSo, as you embark on your journey in this evolving digital landscape, remember that English compression is the tool that will help you make the most of the information-rich world we live in.\nThings like token limit and temperature come in as well, but for this discussion, they are not so important. ↩︎\n",
