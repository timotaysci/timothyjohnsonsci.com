      <description>Taking the AZ-900 - a &amp;ldquo;new to IT&amp;rdquo; perspective. Motivation Having recently moved from Chemical R&amp;amp;D to take up a role within the IT function I have been exposed to some thinking regarding career development outside what I am used to.
I am most impressed with the almost universal need to keep learning new technologies within the IT space - something I am taking to heart. I am also very impressed with the want to solidify learning with certifications.</description>
